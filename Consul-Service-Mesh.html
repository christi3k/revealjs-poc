            HashiCorp's goal is to make tools that support application delivery.

            <strong>Layers.</strong> First, how do we provision the underlying infrastructure? Terraform, along with Packer and Vagrant. How do we secure this infrastructure? Vault. How do we run applications across multiple environments? Nomad. How do we connect and wire all these things together across multiple environments? Consul.

HashiCorp Tools are designed to be Simple, Modular, Composable. (See Tao of HashiCorp.) They work great together, but also are designed to work with your existing infrastructure and tooling.

            Now let's look at how microservices architecture [deployments?] works. With microservices, you're breaking out these subsystems that were previously deployed together, and deploying them separately, possibly on different machines, or even data centers. The sub systems now talk [interact with?] to each other via networked APIs.

Decoupling systems into microservices provides greater operational efficiency. It allows us to get away from the "lowest common denominator" w/r/t development & deployment cycles. Each subsystem can move at its own pace.

            While we gain agility during development, there is no free lunch! We’ve now adopted a set of new operational challenges.

          We won't go into depth about Consul's architecture or how to deploy it in your infrastructure, but let's go over the basics so you understand enough about how Consul works so that the next bit of discussion makes sense.

Consul comes as a single binary that you run in either client or server mode. There's also a dev mode for for experimenting, which of course you should never run in production.

You run a Consul agent on every node in your infrastructure. You usually want to run at least 3 server agents (on dedicated nodes?). Those Consul servers elect a leader and handle data replication using the Raft protocol. Clients participate in the gossip pool. All requests are forwarded through the local Consul agent.

Here is an example of using the DNS interface. By querying for “redis.service.consul” we are asking for a healthy instance of the “redis” service.

            Here is an example of using the HTTP API. Here we’ve queried for all the instances of redis. We can see this output is much richer than DNS, with additional attributes like service tags and service port. The API can be used for deeper integrations, such as thick client side libraries or to configure load balancers and side cars. The API supports edge triggering, so we can get notified of changes in real time.

          <ul>
            <li>Gossip layer provides liveness health check for nodes</li> 
            <li>Agent runs health check locally</li> 
            <li>Only state changes pushed to Consul servers</li>
            <li>Removes unhealthy nodes from service discovery layer</li>
            <li>Many types of checks available including Nagios-compatible scripts, Docker, HTTP and TCP</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            With any service or node, we can register a variety of health checks, including TCP, HTTP, Nagios-style, and more. When any of these health checks change state, the update is pushed to the registry. Because the centrally registry is not pulling updates, its impossible to discern a node failure from an absence of updates. To solve this, Consul uses a lightweight gossip protocol to detect node failures. This architecture allows Consul to scale to thousands of machines per cluster.
